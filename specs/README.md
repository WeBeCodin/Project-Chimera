# Project Chimera Specifications

This directory contains all specifications for Project Chimera, following the **Specification First** directive of the Supercharger Manifesto v3.0.

## Structure

- `ai/` - AI integration specifications
- `api/` - API endpoint specifications  
- `ui/` - User interface specifications
- `database/` - Database schema specifications
- `deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure specifications

## Guidelines

1. **Specification First** - All features must have a specification before implementation
2. **Clear Requirements** - Each spec must define exact requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **Implementation Ready** - Specs should be detailed enough for direct implementation
4. **Version Controlled** - All specs are version controlled and reviewed
5. **Living Documents** - Specs are updated as features evolve

## Format

Specifications should follow this format:
